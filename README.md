# Parallel programming assignment work in C using MPI and OMP
## Two assignments and one larger project working with MPI and OMP to create parallel sections in a simple search algorithm

#### `project_MPI.c` contains a custom broadcast for the large dataset to allow data overlap

#### `project_OMP.c` contains some optimisation around the parallel for loop for controlling the file I/O
